* This is my website
  A compact intro about myself with a few links to my social media profiles

** Developing

Start a development server:

#+begin_src bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
#+end_src


** Building

To create a production version of your app:

#+begin_src bash
npm run build
#+end_src

You can preview the production build with =npm run preview=.

** GitHub Pages

Since I am deploying the website directly to GitHub Pages I would have to
install an adapter from here [[https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters][adapters]].
